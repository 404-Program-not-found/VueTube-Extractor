<strong>VueTube extractor is a library designed to extract data from streaming services. Designed for use in VueTube.</strong>

This is the library for VueTube. The main repository is <a href="https://github.com/Frontesque/VueTube"> here.</a>

VueTube Extractor is currently under active development, and is not a part of the main VueTube app. It is planned to completely replace the current API wrapper employed by VueTube upon completion.
